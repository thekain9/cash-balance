# CASH BALANCE APP 
I have developed an application designed to execute specific financial operations. Users can conveniently perform deposits and withdrawals, with the added functionality of applying a 5% interest increase and a 15% reduction in charges. This application aims to streamline financial transactions with precision and efficiency, providing users with a comprehensive tool for managing their financial activities.

## GET STARTED
Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:
1. Install node.js / npm
2. Clone the repository "https://github.com/thekain9/cash-balance"
3. Navigate to the newly created folder "cd cash-balance"
4. Install dependencies 
5. Start the app using the command "npm start".

Enjoy the app!
